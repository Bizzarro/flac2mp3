{"google":"","body":"About flac2mp3\r\n==============\r\n\r\nflac2mp3 is a perl script that will search for flac files within\r\na directory hierarchy and convert them all to mp3 format, creating a\r\nmatching directory structure in the process.\r\n\r\nI wrote it as I have a large collection of flac files but need to\r\nconvert them to mp3 format for use with my iPod.\r\n\r\nThere are a few programs that can do basic file format conversion\r\nbut I found that it was hard to detect which files were new in my\r\nflac collection and to convert just those files. I also find I update\r\nthe metadata in my flac files fairly often (when I spot mistakes, etc.)\r\nand needed  a way to update just the tags rather than running the whole\r\nconversion process again.\r\n\r\nflac2mp3 can do this.\r\n\r\nIt can take a directory structure like this:\r\n\r\nlossless\r\n  |\r\n  +--Coldplay\r\n  |    |\r\n  |    +--Parachutes\r\n  |         |\r\n  |         +-- 01 - Don't Panic.flac\r\n  |             02 - Shiver.flac\r\n  +--The Chameleons\r\n       |\r\n       +Script of the Bridge\r\n          |\r\n          +-- 01 - Don't Fall.flac\r\n              02 - Here Today.flac\r\n\r\nAnd produce a directory structure like this:\r\n\r\nlossy\r\n  |\r\n  +--Coldplay\r\n  |    |\r\n  |    +--Parachutes\r\n  |         |\r\n  |         +-- 01 - Don't Panic.mp3\r\n  |             02 - Shiver.mp3\r\n  +--The Chameleons\r\n       |\r\n       +Script of the Bridge\r\n          |\r\n          +-- 01 - Don't Fall.mp3\r\n              02 - Here Today.mp3\r\n\r\nThe command to do this is:\r\n\r\n  flac2mp3.pl /path/to/lossless /path/to/lossy\r\n\r\nNow, suppose I notice that I've spelled \"coldplay\" wrongly. I simply\r\nuse a tag editor to correct the flac files then run flac2mp3 again\r\nto update the tags in the mp3 files:\r\n\r\n  flac2mp3.pl /path/to/lossless /path/to/lossy\r\n\r\nflac2mp3 will detect that just the tags have changed in the flac files\r\nand update the mp3 files without re-transcoding. \r\n\r\nCommand-line options can be seen by typing \"flac2mp3.pl\" with no options:\r\n\r\nUsage: ./flac2mp3.pl [--pretend] [--quiet] [--debug] [--tagsonly] [--force]\r\n[--tagdiff] <flacdir> <mp3dir>\r\n    --pretend       Don't actually do anything\r\n    --quiet         Disable informational output to stdout\r\n    --debug         Enable debugging output. For developers only!\r\n    --tagsonly      Don't do any transcoding - just update tags\r\n    --force         Force transcoding and tag update even if not required\r\n    --tagdiff       Print source/dest tag values if different\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nAs of v0.2.6 all non-standard perl modules are supplied in the archive.\r\nInstallation should be as simple as extracting the archive into a \r\ndirectory of your choice.\r\n\r\nFor example, on linux:\r\n\r\n # cd ~/bin\r\n # tar zxvf flac2mp3-0.3.0.tar.gz\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you can use Winzip or other utility to unzip the file and\r\nextract the archive.\r\n\r\nMailing lists\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe following mailing lists are available:\r\n\r\nList address: flac2mp3-announce@robinbowes.com\r\nDescription:  Read-only list for announcements\r\nTo subscribe: flac2mp3-announce-subscribe@robinbowes.com\r\n\r\nList address: flac2mp3-devel@robinbowes.com\r\nDescription:  Developer discussion\r\nTo subscribe: flac2mp3-devel-subscribe@robinbowes.com\r\n\r\nList address: flac2mp3-general@robinbowes.com\r\nDescription:  General user discussion\r\nTo subscribe: flac2mp3-general-subscribe@robinbowes.com\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues to robin-flac2mp3@robinbowes.com\r\n\r\nRobin Bowes\r\nJuly 2007\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
