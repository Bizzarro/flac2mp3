# To-do:
#  - Extend to apply all legal tags in FLAC field (esp. Composer,
#    Conductor, etc.)
#  - Still falls over with certain characters in filename, e.g.
#    Rock `N' Roll Suicide.flac
#  - Clean up filepaths (check for double // in dirnames)
#  - Clean up and rationalise program output, e.g. produce a sensible
#    level of output by default unless a --quiet switch is used
#  - Investigate using Audio::FLAC::Decode and Audio::MPEG instead of
#    flac and lame programs used from system call
#  - Write OO Audio file objects that know how to decode/encode/get
#    tags/set tags for themselves - should open up the way to allow for
#    transcoding between additional formats.
#  - google for a standard perl script template include things like
#    options, pod, GPL statement, how to set program version, etc. etc.
#  - Use Carp module
#  - Use Shell::Quote module
